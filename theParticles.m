%PROJECT TWO HERE WE GOOOO
%% The Particles 
% We want to make a list of particles with 'random' densities, charges, and
% starting places along the i axis.

particleConc = 75;

% The plan is to use the integer number of the concentration of smog as the
% number of particles to model
particleConc = floor(particleConc);

particleList = 1:particleConc;
